## Overview

### Web3.0

Web 3.0 is a decentralized network that represents the next phase of the internet (Web 2.0). Unlike  its predecessors, Web 3.0 prioritizes user privacy and data ownership through blockchain and smart contracts, enabling direct interactions without middlemen. This approach aims to improve security, transparency, and trust in online activities, opening doors for new applications and services.

### Cryptocurrency and Cryptography

- Cryptocurrency is a type virtual currency that that relies on cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form and have no physical counterpart.  
- Cryptography is the process of securing communication and data from unauthorized access, using complex mathematical algorithms for the encryption, making it almost impossible to decipher.

### Token

The type of cryptocurrency that will be studied in this project is a Token.
Unlike coins (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) that operate on their own independent blockchain, Tokens use an existing blockchain to perform their wide-range functionalities that are managed by a smart contract.
Coins are primarily used as a medium of exchange, data storage, or transaction payment. Whereas Tokens represent a variety of assets or utilities, such as digital assets, access to platform-specific services, or even voting rights within a decentralized application (dApp).

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts are hosted on a blockchain and are automatically executed when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts play a pivotal role in decentralized applications (dApps) and advanced functionalities, requiring robust blockchains capable of handling complex computations and data.

### Blockchain

Blockchain is a type of distributed database designed to record, store, and transmit data securely across a decentralized network. It removes the need for a central authority by allowing participants (nodes) to manage and verify data collectively. The data is stored in “blocks” that are linked together in a chronological order, forming a continuous “chain,” which makes the entire system resistant to modification and tampering.

#### How does it work

- **Transaction Creation**: A transaction is initiated by a user (e.g., sending cryptocurrency, executing a smart contract, or storing data). This transaction is broadcast to the network.

- **Verification**: Nodes (computers on the network) verify the transaction using a consensus mechanism, ensuring that the data is valid and complies with the rules of the blockchain.

- **Block Creation**: Once verified, the transaction is bundled together with others into a "block." The block is then added to the chain in chronological order.

- **Consensus Mechanism**: The network reaches consensus on the validity of the block, depending on the type of blockchain, either through PoW, PoS, or other mechanisms. This process ensures that the blockchain remains consistent across all nodes.

- **Finalization**: Once consensus is reached, the new block is added to the chain, and the ledger is updated across all participants in the network.
